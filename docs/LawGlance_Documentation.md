## Overview
 
LawGlance provides a free, open-source platform that simplifies legal research by retrieving and presenting legal information in an easy-to-understand manner. Currently focused on Indian laws, LawGlance enables users to get concise responses to complex legal queries using a combination of machine learning, natural language processing, and vector embeddings.
 
The long-term goal is to expand LawGlance to cover international laws and make it a global legal AI assistant.
 
## Features
 
- **AI-Powered Legal Assistance**: Provides quick, accurate responses to legal questions.
- **Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Uses RAG to gather relevant legal information from a vast legal corpus.
- **Open Source**: Completely free and open for contributions from the community.
- **Multi-Platform Access**: Responsive design suitable for mobile and web platforms.
- **Extendable Architecture**: Can be expanded to other legal systems in the future.
 
## Technologies Used
 
- **Python**: Core programming language for backend development.
- **LangChain**: For building conversational AI pipelines and managing RAG workflows.
- **ChromaDB**: Vector database (using `db_legal_bot_part1`) to manage legal document embeddings and facilitate information retrieval.
- **Django**: Web framework for structuring backend API.
- **Streamlit**: Interface for running the application prototype.
- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend for styling and responsive UI design.
 
## Installation
 
	Follow these steps to set up and run LawGlance locally.
 
	1. **Clone the Repository**:
	   ```bash
	   git clone https://github.com/lawglance/lawglance.git
	   cd lawglance
	   ```
	2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
 
		```bash
			python -m venv env
			source env/bin/activate   # For Linux/macOS
			env\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
		```
	3. **Install Requirements**:
 
		```bash
		pip install -r requirements.txt
		```
	4. **Set up ChromaDB**: Ensure ```chroma_db_legal_bot_part1``` is properly configured for managing the embeddings and retrieval.
 
	5. **Run the Streamlit App**:
		```bash
		streamlit run app.py
		```
	6. **Access LawGlance**: Open the URL provided by Streamlit in your terminal to view the application.
 
## Usage
 
- **Ask Legal Questions**: Users can type in legal questions related to Indian law, and LawGlance will retrieve relevant responses.
- **Review Relevant Context**: LawGlance provides contextual information to ensure accuracy.
- **Contribute Feedback**: Users are encouraged to provide feedback, which helps improve the AI model’s accuracy and relevance.
 
## Project Structure
